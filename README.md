### WHAT
EVE is a cool fun voice assistant that is always there for you. Currently she only knows how to play the number guessing game, but she will learn more skills in no time. 

### WHY
I built this to gain more experience with Python and to tinker with voice technology. The main objective is to pretty much learn and have fun.
